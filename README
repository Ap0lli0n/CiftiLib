The CiftiLib library requires QT to compile, and optionally uses zlib if you want to use its NIfTI reading capabilities for other purposes.  4.8.x releases are known to work, newer versions may work, but have not been tested.

It is currently set up to be compiled, along with a simple example, by cmake:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../CiftiLib
#OR
cmake-gui ../CiftiLib
make
